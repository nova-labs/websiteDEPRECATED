Nova-labs.org website
=====================

This is the live website.  Pushing to the github repo will result in a hook
being run that will make the latest version of the master branch go LIVE
at http://nova-labs.org.  Be warned!


Actually, you probably don't want to push to master, even if you have
permissions to.  Instead, make a topic branch and submit a Pull Request
and get at least one other person to sanity-check your changes and
then merge your Pull Request.

Github as some [docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
on how to use pull requests - you can use either the 'Fork and Pull' or
'Shared Repository' development models, as appropriate to your permission
level in the repo.

If you have questions or issues with git, you can ask [pj](http://place.org/~pj/contact.html)
or check out Github's excellent [help articles](https://help.github.com/).
