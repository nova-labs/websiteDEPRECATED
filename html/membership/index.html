		<p><em><strong>We want you to be a part of our community so here&#8217;s what you need to know.</strong></em></p>
<p>There are three levels of participation in Nova Labs community:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attendee</strong> &#8211; access to lectures, classes, and meetups</li>
<li><strong>Associate Member</strong> &#8211; full access during open hours</li>
<li><strong>Member</strong> &#8211; 24/7 access with key and other privileges</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone must sign a liability waiver except Attendees visiting for classroom-only events.</p>
<p><strong>How do I become an Attendee?<br />
</strong>There&#8217;s nothing you must do to become an Attendee other than show up for an event.</p>
<p><strong>How do I become an Associate Member?</strong><br />
Want to use the resources of Nova Labs? Want to become a part of our community? Everyone starts as an Associate Member by first signing the waiver, finding a Sponsor, and then getting involved. Everyone will be an Associate for at least a couple months.</p>
<p>A Sponsor is a Member you&#8217;ve gotten to know well enough that they agree to vouch for you. If you&#8217;re ever in the Labs and someone questions you being there you can put their mind at ease by telling them, &#8220;It&#8217;s OK, my sponsor is [SPONSOR'S NAME]&#8221; which they can then verify in our database. This simple technique allows us to be sure there are no strangers lurking in the Labs who could get themselves or others in to trouble. We want a safe environment for everyone.</p>
<p>Though you have free run of our facility, as an Associate Member this is only when Nova Labs is open, which means our front door is unlocked and a Member is present. Normal open hours are published in our <a title="calendar" href="https://www.nova-labs.org/calendar/">calendar</a>. At any time you can look in the upper right corner of <a href="https://www.nova-labs.org/blog/">Nova-Labs.org</a> to see the Nova Labs Open/Closed status.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are some Nova Labs tools which require training before being available. Use of any wood shop tools requires our safety orientation class. Certain specialty tools such as the laser cutter and 3D printer require special training. We want you to have confidence and be safe when using our resources so please ask if in doubt.</p>
<p>Associate Members are asked to show their support at a recommended $50/month.</p>
<p><strong>How do I become a Member?<br />
</strong>The primary difference between Associate Member and full Member is Board approval.<br />
The path you travel to get Board approval is called the Nova Labs Maker Quest.<br />
Your guide on this journey is your Sponsor who should coach you to success.</p>
<p>To become a full Member requires proving to the Board that you&#8217;re worthy of getting a key and receiving 24/7 access. This means becoming a constructive addition to the community where the metrics are: 1) <strong>involvement</strong> in projects, committees, or builds 2) <strong>contribution</strong> of knowledge through training &amp; mentoring and 3) <strong>support</strong>, both financial and community. Done well these activities will improve Nova Labs and will be noticed by the Board such that when your Sponsor presents your candidacy for Membership at a Board meeting, the outcome should be a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Members are required to pay a non-optional dues of $100/month.</p>
<p><strong>Why does Nova Labs take this approach to membership?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re a rather small makerspace. Furthermore, if you know our story then you know we&#8217;re located in a building which will be torn down in the not-to-distant future (2014?). How this affects membership is that we need to build a solid community which will support and survive a relocation, hence the Maker Quest for Membership. We also desperately want our resources to be available to as many people as possible hence the Associate Membership. And finally, when ever we can we want to support outside groups which are aligned with our mission so we make our space is available for Attendee events.</p>
