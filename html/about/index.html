<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Nova Labs is a community-based Makerspace in Reston, Virginia that was created in 2011 for the purpose of empowering everyone to 
rediscover the joy of making things. By providing the space, resources and mentorship for innovation and creation, Nova Labs creates a model
for disrupting STEM education to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists, and entrepreneurs.

<br>

<h2>Our Culture</h2>

<p>As a community, we confront the reality of the creative process and embrace the investment, struggle and failure required to make something great. By empowering natural curiosity, we teach that thereâ€™s joy finding solutions to challenging problems. This is a message we actively promote to build the confidence and accept failure as a necessary rite of passage to success and longevity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.

<br>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<p>To support our purpose of empowering the community to become makers, we provide classes in core STEM topics such as programming and engineering fundamentals, building and using devices such as 3D printers, drones, laser cutters, Arduinos, robots, and CNC machines, and fundamental engineering and prototyping skills such as wood working and carbon fiber mold making. 

<p>We focus our efforts on altering how youth learn the skills necessary to succeed in the modern job market. Rather than accepting passive learning, Nova Labs encourages children to actively invent and build solutions to challenging problems, test hypotheses through hands-on experimentation, and to develop critical inquiry, analysis, technical, and motor skills. 

<br>

<h2>Our Vision</h2>

<p>To empower everyone to rediscover the joy of making things.</p>

<br>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p><ul>
<li>To provide a community workshop where people can learn, teach and collaborate on technical and industrial works; and,</li>
<li>To promote the usefulness of competence in the technical and industrial arts to the public; and,</li>
<li>To serve as a center of information about the technical and industrial arts for members, schools, other interested groups, and the general public.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Sustainability and Growth Challenges</h2>

<p>In the two years since our founding, Nova Labs has grown to over 100 dues-paying members and over 400 classes and events serving over 5,000 participants. Our volunteer-based operation allows us to maintain a very low cost structure where 100% of our revenue stream goes directly into supporting the space, the programs and the equipment required to meet our mission. 

<p>Nova Labs is currently facing a challenge to its existence and ability to meet our educational and innovation goals. Our current space is located in close proximity to Reston Station metro stop at Wiehle Avenue. Redevelopment of our current building is planned to start later this year. We have found a new space that will allow us to better meet the needs of the community. However, the up-front costs of relocating requires that we seek immediate, additional financial support.
