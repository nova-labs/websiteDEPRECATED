<h1>Super Novas - Nova Labs Program for Young Makers</h1>

<p>
    'Super Novas' is our program for younger kids (roughly ages 3-10).  It is
    intended to have a periodic organized activity for kids with a focus on
    Maker interests (DIY, Arts and Crafts, Inventing, Science, etc).  We are
    also working on a youth membership program that would allow kids ages 10-18
    to become Youth Members at Nova Labs and have supervised access to the
    regular Nova Labs activities, tools and equipment.
