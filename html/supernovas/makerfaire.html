<h1>Super Novas - Maker Faire NOVA 2014</h1>

<p>Here is a sneak preview of what we have planned for <a
href="http://makerfairenova.com/">Maker Faire</a>.  Make sure you come visit
us!  Sunday, Marxh 16, 2014 from 11 AM to 4 PM at South Lakes High School and
Hughes Middle School!</p>

<h2>The Internet of Things for Kids!</h2>

<p>How do you teach kids about Internet of Things concepts?  By connecting
things to Minecraft!  We're going to have a bunch of Minecraft stations
connected to a server, where kids can come and run around and play with things
in the game that are connected to things in the real world.</p>

<p>Some of the things we're working on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFID readers positioned around the area correspond to spawn points in the
game.  A collection of RFID tags labeled with various Minecraft animals and
creatures will also be available.  Swipe the 'chicken' tag at one of the
readers, and make a chicken appear in the game (or swipe you badge from work
and who knows what might happen!)</li>
<li>"World Control Panel" - A mission-control like panel that gives you
ultimate Minecraft power!  Someone is lighting the town on fire?  Press the
"thunderstorm" button!  The fire is out and you are tired of rain?  Push the
"Sunny Day" button!  Just want to cause some general mayhem?  How about those
buttons labeled 'fireworks', 'lightning' or 'zombie'?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Squishy Circuits</h2>
<p>This was a big hit the first time we did it, and we're going to be doing it
even bigger this time!  How much bigger?  I recently placed an order for 2,000
LEDs!</p>

<h2>Crayon Recycler</h2>
<p>If you are a parent, I can pretty much guarantee that you have a box of broken crayons sitting around your house somewhere!  Bring them with you to MakerFaire and make them even better with our Crayon Recycler!  Star Crayons!  Mustache Crayons!  Robot Crayons!</p>

<h2>More! More! More!</h2>
<p>I can hear you saying "Wow, that's great?  What else do you have planned?",
and I'm glad you asked!  One of the things that I've always thought that Super
Novas needed was a mascot, otherwise Super Novas t-shirts would be boring, and
we can't have boring!  So, meet the new Super Novas mascot!</p>

<h2>More? More? More?</h2>
<p>Yes!  There are other things in the works too!  But you'll have to show up to find out about the rest of them!</p>
