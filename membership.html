<h1>Nova Labs Membership</h1>
<h5 style="text-align:center; margin:16px 0px;">Nova Labs encourages a diverse and connected community through involved participants.</h5>
  <p>At Nova Labs we're excited to be building a high-quality community of involved Makers. We want to encourage everyone to be as involved as you're able. Everyone is welcome to join any of our public events and activities, and to use our facilities during open hours. If you would like to become a full member, then you need to complete a Maker Quest and apply through your Sponsor.</p>
